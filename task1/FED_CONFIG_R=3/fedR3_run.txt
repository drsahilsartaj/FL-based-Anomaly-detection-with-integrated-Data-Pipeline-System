First, I completed all of the Task 1 setup steps. Then I opened the .env file and confirmed that ROUNDS was set to 3 and EPOCHS to 2. Next, in one terminal I ran:

"./start_datapipeline.sh docker-compose-task1.yaml"

In a second terminal, I started the live plot viewer with:

"python3 live_plots.py"

The output I see by default is the graph here.
